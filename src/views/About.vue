            About Chellez Kitchen
          </h1>
          <h1 class="title is-4" style="color: white;">
             I am a self-taught Chef, based on life skills and generation experience; starting from my grandmother, mother, father and family to be general. 
             With conviction and direct feedback from those that I am able to give service, from the work of my hands, 
             it is satisfactory to provide a balanced diet, considering the ratio of the proletariat as per the bourgeois; 
             who can afford a balanced diet.We talk, about Africa being a ‘dark continent’ but it is full of raw materials and staple foods; wheat, rice, wheat and sorghum, full of nutrients that we supply to core countries. 
             As an International Relations student, some meals have been able to bring and promote not only nutrition but, Pan Africanism for example maize flour used to make ‘Ugali’ in East Africa, ‘Fufu’ in West Africa and ‘Pap’ in South Africa, 
             has brought a common relation to which not only neighbouring countries can relate with socially but also economically strengthening the continents potential. 
             Food to me is not just an absorption to maintain life and growth but nourishment to why there is a need to absorb the food provided which, 
             Chellez Kitchen (my company) caters to.
